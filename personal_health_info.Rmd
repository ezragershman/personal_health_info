## R Markdown
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
cleaned_steps_data <- read_csv("cleaned_steps_data.csv",
  col_types = cols(startDate = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
  endDate = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
  date = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d")))

```


```{r}
daily_steps_summary <- cleaned_steps_data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_steps = sum(value), .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r}
summary_stats <- daily_steps_summary %>%
  summarise(
    mean_steps = mean(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_steps = median(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_steps = min(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_steps = max(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
